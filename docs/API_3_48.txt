2 INTRODUCTION 
2.1 ABOUT YO! PAYMENTS 
Yo! Payments is a revolutionary mobile payments gateway service. Yo! Payments enables businesses to 
receive payments from their customers via mobile money, as well as make mobile money payments to 
any mobile money account holder.  Yo! Payments also has the capability to send mobile calling credit 
(“airtime”) directly to users. Yo! Payments offers a rich API which enables seamless integration with 
websites, IVR services, SMS services and any other medium through which businesses interact with their 
customers. Yo! Payments also offers an “internal transfer” service which enables account holders to 
cheaply transfer funds amongst each other. 
Yo! Payments essentially opens the door for all types of businesses to benefit from the highly successful 
mobile money transfer phenomenon. 
2.2 YO! PAYMENTS API 
Yo! Payments offers an Application Programming Interface (API) for businesses who wish to customize 
their customers’ payment experience. The API is only available for Business Account holders. 
2.3 SUPPORTED OPERATIONS 
The API provides support for both transaction-oriented operations and non transaction-oriented 
operations.  A transaction-oriented operation is an operation intended to result in the transfer of funds 
from one account to another account. 
2.3.1 
Transaction-oriented Operations 
The API supports the following transaction-oriented operations.  Note that these operations are also 
available from the Web Interface. 
 Withdraw Funds 
 Deposit Funds 
 Internal Transfer 
 Airtime Transfer 
2.3.2 
Non Transaction-oriented Operations 
Following are the non transaction-oriented operations supported by the API: 
 Check Transaction Status 
 Check Account Balance 
 Get Mini-Statement 
 Verify Account Validity 
All the above operations are fully described in the later sections of this document.

 19 Copyright © 2006 – 2020 Yo! Uganda Limited 
www.yo.co.ug 
API Specification 
depending on your 
internally established 
business rules. This 
parameter requires you 
to provide the name of 
the file you are attaching, 
as a string, for example 
“receipt.doc” or 
“receipt.pdf”. Note that 
the contents of this 
parameter are ignored if 
you have not provided 
the contents of the file 
using 
NarrativeFileBase64 
below. 
NarrativeFileBase64 String Optional This parameter enables 
you to attach a file to the 
transaction. This is 
useful, for example, in 
the case where you may 
want to attached a 
scanned receipt, or a 
scanned payment 
authorization, depending 
on your business rules. 
This parameter requires 
you to provide the 
contents of the file you

base-64 encoding. Note 
that the contents of this 
parameter are ignored if 
you have not provided a 
file name using 
NarrativeFileName 
above. 
InternalReference String Optional In this field, provide an 
internal transaction 
reference. If this transfer 
is related to another 
system transaction, enter 
its reference code in this 
field. If you are unsure 
about the meaning of this 
field, do not include it in 
your request. This field is 
 
 20 Copyright © 2006 – 2020 Yo! Uganda Limited 
www.yo.co.ug 
API Specification 
useful in linking this 
request to another 
existing transaction 
which is already in the 
system. 
ExternalReference String Optional In this field, enter an 
external transaction 
reference. An external 
transaction reference is 
something which yourself 
and the benecifiary agree 
upon. For example, this 
may be an invoice 
number, or a phrase 
describing the purpose of 
this transaction in a way 
that the beneficiary 
would understand. This 
field is optional and you 
may omit it in your 
request. 
ProviderReferenceText String Optional In this field, enter text 
you wish to be present in 
any confirmation 
message which the 
mobile money provider 
network sends to the 
subscriber upon 
successful completion of 
the transaction. Some 
mobile money providers 
automatically send a 
confirmatory text 
message to the 
subscriber upon 
completion of 
transactions. This 
parameter allows you to 
provide some text which 
will be appended to any 
such confirmatory 
message sent to the 
subscriber. 
PublicKeyAuthenticationNonce String Optional This parameter is 
optional if public key 
authentication is not 
 
 21 Copyright © 2006 – 2020 Yo! Uganda Limited 
www.yo.co.ug 
API Specification 
enabled for your account. 
If public key 
authentication is 
enabled, this parameter 
is mandatory. If 
specified, this must be 
set to a string whose 
maximum length is 255 
characters. 
This string must be 
composed of 
alphanumeric characters – [a-zA-z0-9]. It can also 
contain commas (,), 
hyphens (-), and plus 
signs (+). 
The value submitted 
under this parameter 
must be unique and must 
never have been 
submitted in any API 
request. One way of 
ensuring that you submit 
unique values under this 
parameter is by 
implementing a counter 
starting from 1 which 
should be incremented 
on each API request. 
You can also devise 
other methods of 
generating unique values 
that can be used for this 
parameter.  
 
IMPORTANT NOTE: 
This parameter is 
expected to be unique 
even in the event that the 
transaction does not 
succeed. 
It must be unique for 
each API call made, 
regardless of the status 
 
 22 Copyright © 2006 – 2020 Yo! Uganda Limited 
www.yo.co.ug 
API Specification 
of the transaction.  
Therefore, do not set this 
parameter to your private 
transaction identifier 
especially if your 
transaction identifiers 
may be re-used or re
submitted later. This 
parameter is tagged to 
the API call and must be 
unique for each API call. 
PublicKeyAuthenticationSignatureBase64 String Optional This parameter is 
optional but mandatory if 
public key authentication 
is turned on for your 
account. 
Maximum length of this 
field is 4096 characters. 
Obtain this parameter as 
follows: 
 
a) Concatenate the 
values of the following 
parameters  in the 
indicated order as they 
appear below: 
 APIUsername 
 Amount 
 Account 
 Narrative  
 ExternalReference 
 PublicKeyAuthenti
cationNonce 
Note the following: (i) If 
your Narrative 
parameter is longer than 
255 characters, only the 
first 255 characters of the 
Narrative parameter 
should be used in the 
concatenation. (ii) If your 
ExternalReference 
 
 23 Copyright © 2006 – 2020 Yo! Uganda Limited 
www.yo.co.ug 
API Specification 
parameter is longer than 
255 characters, only the 
first 255 characters of the 
ExternalReference 
parameter should be 
used in the 
concatenation.  (iii) If 
your 
PublicKeyAuthenticat
ionNonce parameter is 
longer than 255 
characters, only the first 
255 characters of the 
PublicKeyAuthenticat
ionNonce parameter 
should be used in the 
concatenation.   
b) Next, obtain an SHA1 
hash of the above string 
in [a]; 
c) Calculate the RSA 
signature of the SHA1 
hash obtained in [b] 
above using your private 
key associated with your 
public key. (NOTE: Your 
public key will be 
configured under your 
Yo! Payments account 
profile. If you have not 
already done so, please 
share your public key 
with your account 
representative to have it 
configured under your 
profile. DO NOT share 
your private key with any 
one – not even with the 
Yo! Payments support 
staff. Your private is like 
a password which you 
only must know) 
d) Base64-encode the 
RSA signature calculated 
in [c] above. 
 
API Specification 
4.2 HOW TO GENERATE A PRIVATE / PUBLIC KEY 
If public key authentication is turned on for your account, you are required to sign all your 
acwithdrawfunds API requests using a private key. The public key associated with private key you use 
to sign the API requests will be used to verify the signatures received in your API requests. You can 
generate a private / public key pair using the following procedure: 
4.2.1 
Using OpenSSL On Linux 
First, generate a private key by running the following command: 
$ openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048 
If the above command is run, file private_key.pem will be written. This is your private key. 
IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not share your private key with anyone – not even with the Yo! Payments 
support staff or your account representative. 
Next, extract the public key associated with the private key using the following command: 
$ openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem 
If the above command is run, file public_key.pem will be written. This is your public key that you’re 
supposed to share with your Yo! Payments account representative for configuration under your Yo! 
Payments account profile. 
4.2.2 
Using OpenSSL On Windows 
The instructions given below are for a Windows 10 64-bit system. 
1. Download OpenSSL from the link below: 
https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html 
Scroll to the section “Download Win32/Win64 OpenSSL” and choose a non-light version of 
OpenSSL as shown below: 
Choose the “EXE” link under “Win64 OpenSSL v1.1.1d” from above. 
2. Install OpenSSL by clicking the downloaded executable. In the example given above, the 
executable downloaded was “Win64OpenSSL-1_1_1d.exe”. 
Copyright © 2006 – 2020 Yo! Uganda Limited 
www.yo.co.ug 
24
API Specification 
3. Assuming the installation has placed the “openssl.exe” executable at  
"C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\openssl.exe", generate the private / public key 
pair by running the following commands: 
Generate private key: 
"C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\openssl.exe" genpkey -algorithm RSA -out 
private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048 
If the above command is run, file private_key.pem will be written. This is your private key. 
IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not share your private key with anyone – not even with the Yo! 
Payments support staff or your account representative. 
Next, extract the public key associated with the private key using the following command: 
"C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\openssl.exe" rsa -pubout -in 
private_key.pem -out public_key.pem 
If the above command is run, file public_key.pem will be written. This is your public key that 
you’re supposed to share with your Yo! Payments account representative for configuration under 
your Yo! Payments account profile. 
The screenshot below shows a practical demonstration of the output of the above commands.
